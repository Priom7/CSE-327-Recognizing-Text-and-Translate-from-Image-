Dear Sir, 
I am Sharif Ahmed, ID: 1410286042 

i have talked with you at your office about my PC problem. You suggested me to do my work from any group member's computer. 

I have added a new feature in the app. Now the app can translate the text from ENGLISH to SPANISH. I have committed the new features few minutes back from MD. Sharif Alam (1530013042)

My commit number is : 9257817 .
I sent it 11th August. 

Though android studio is new for me, i worked with my group members especially Sharif Alam and learned how to work with it.
